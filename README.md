## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I used w3docs.com and rapidtables.com.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
The only challenges I encountered were with the optional features. I did not have time to complete them, but I will try and complete them soon. I tried creating a label to let the user know whose turn it is.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I don't have any questions yet.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would complete the optional features and more. I would clean up the comments as well.
